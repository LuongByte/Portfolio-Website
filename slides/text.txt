Background; I am from Metro Vancouver with a Vietnamese background. Having had an interest in working with computers and programming ever since I was in elementary school, whether it be creating mods for my favourite games or tinkering with computer parts, pursuing a career in computer science was a clear choice.
Education; Currently, I am working toward completing my Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science at SFU along with learning some usefull programming skills on the side. In addition, after having taken some of the field's electives, I decided to minor in Business which I will complete at the same time. 
Hobbies; I enjoy cycling and hiking, as they not only help maintain my fitness but the changes in scenery are great for clearing my mind, especially after spending most of the week in front of a computer screen.
